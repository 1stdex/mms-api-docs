- **Claiming:** distributions move owed base/quote so makers can `CLAIM` their proceeds.
- **Auto‑cancel:** only **sell orders that became under‑collateralized after a distribution** are **auto‑cancelled** during the distribution process.
- **Pause semantics:** books may be **paused** while a distribution runs; do not assume liveness during that window.
