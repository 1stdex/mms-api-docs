## Books

- Two books per pair: **base→quote** (sell base) and **quote→base** (sell quote). We refer to them by a deterministic `BookId`.
- Each book is defined by a **BookKey**: `(base, quote, unitSize, makerPolicy, takerPolicy)`.
- Orders in a book share the same `unitSize` and fee policies. Units are **integers**; the notional is `unit * unitSize` in the *book’s base currency*.

## Ticks

- Price levels are discrete **ticks** with type `Tick` (signed 24‑bit integer). Ticks are **global** (shared across books).

## Providers & referrers

- Every order must set a **provider** address:
  - In the **sell‑base** book, use the **sell provider**.
  - In the **sell‑quote** book, use the **buy provider**.
- `referrer` is optional; leave as `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` unless you have a program.

## Controller entrypoint

All contract calls are funneled via the **Controller**. The single method is:

```solidity
function execute(
  Action[] calldata actionList,
  bytes[] calldata paramsDataList,
  ERC20PermitParams[] calldata erc20PermitParamsList,
  uint64 deadline
) external returns (OrderId[] memory ids);
```

The `paramsDataList` items are ABI‑encoded structs for each action. See [Controller reference](/reference/controller).
