The subgraph exposes typed entities. Below are working examples aligned with the schema.

### Books (paginate)

```graphql
query Books($first: Int!, $skip: Int!) {
  books(first: $first, skip: $skip, orderBy: id) {
    id
    base { id symbol decimals }
    quote { id symbol decimals }
    unitSize
    makerPolicy { fee isFeeInQuote }
    takerPolicy { fee isFeeInQuote }
  }
}
```

### Depth by price level

```graphql
query Depth($book: ID!, $first: Int!) {
  book(id: $book) {
    id
    depths(first: $first, orderBy: tick, orderDirection: desc) {
      tick
      unitAmount
      baseAmount
      quoteAmount
    }
  }
}
```

### Open orders for a user in a book

```graphql
query MyOpenOrdersInBook($owner: Bytes!, $book: ID!) {
  openOrders(where: { owner: $owner, book: $book }, orderBy: tick, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    orderIndex
    tick
    unitAmount
    claimableQuoteAmount
    createdAt
  }
}
```
