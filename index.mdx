# 1st DEX — Market Maker API

These docs cover how to **quote**, **update**, and **risk‑manage** orders programmatically using:

- The on‑chain **Controller** contract (single entrypoint) to batch trading actions.
- The **Subgraph** to read books, orders, and fills with low latency.

> **Architecture:** each *pair* has **two order books**, one per direction. Orders are denominated in **units** (multiples of `unitSize`) at discrete **ticks**. See [Core concepts](/concepts/core).

## What’s different vs AMM DEXes?

- **Price–time priority** instead of pools and curves.
- **Quote‑collateralized** makers: quote is locked when you `MAKE`, released when you `CANCEL` or after `CLAIM`.
- **Fee model** via **providers** and (optional) referrers.
- **Single batch entrypoint**: all actions go through `Controller.execute(...)` so you can atomically make/take/cancel/claim in one tx.

## What you’ll build

- A minimal TS bot that posts/cancels quotes.
- Subgraph queries for **book depth**, **your live orders**, and **fills**.
- Safe patterns around **distributions** (claim/cancel automation).
