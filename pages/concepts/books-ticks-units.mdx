## Units

Every book has a fixed `unitSize` (an amount of **base** for that book). All maker sizes are expressed in **units** (uint64). Actual base/quote amounts are derived from the `unitSize` and the tickâ€™s price.

## Ticks

Ticks are discrete signed integers (`int24`). Conversions:

- `int24 MIN_TICK = -8_388_608`, `MAX_TICK = 8_388_607`.
- ABI type is `int24` when encoding parameters.

> Implementation note: see `Tick.sol` for the exact definition.
